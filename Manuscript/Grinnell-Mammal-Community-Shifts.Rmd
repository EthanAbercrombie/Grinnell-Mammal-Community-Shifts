# Introduction

Paragraph 1: Broad importance

-   Climate change is causing the reshuffling of ecological communities.

-   This is especially important in montane ecosystems where species have smaller ranges and environmental gradients are compressed.

-   Understanding community-wide responses can lend insight into the factors driving biodiversity. (assembly)

    -   Can lend insight into how biodiversity will respond in the future.

-   These efforts are critical for conservation (need specific conservation topics).

Climate change has widespread effects on the distribution (), abundance (), and behavior () of species around the world, leading to the reshuffling of ecological communities (). The effects of climate change are particularly pronounced in montane ecosystems where compressed environmental gradients lead to rapid turnover in biodiversity across elevation. Mountain ranges around the world harbor []%75 percent of global terrestrial species richnesss -- understaning how ecological communities in montane ecosystems respond to climate change is imperative in safeguarding biodiversity.

Paragraph 2: Knowledge gap

-   One popular hypothesis that has support is that species will migrate upwards to track environmental preferences.

    -   This hypothesis makes two predictions 1) individual species should exhibit range shifts with concomitant climate preferences, and 2) thermophilizaiton and mesophilization on a community level.

-   There is mixed support for prediction 1:

    -   This has mixed support as individual species migrate upwards, stay the same, or even shift downward.

        -   Highlight mixed results more prominently, where some studies are inline with prediction 1 and others are not.

    -   Could be a result of different mechanisms (different factors of climate, biotic interactions) -- highlight these as a cause of why we see different responses (leaves tension).

        -   Mechanisms: Other climatic factors (water balance), biotic interactions, dispersal limitation.

-   Knowledge gap: It remains unclear to what extant individual responses to climate change scales up to directional changes in community-level outcomes.

One popular hypothesis is that species will move to higher elevations to track preferred thermal regimes (). This hypothesis makes two predictions: 1)

One popular hypothesis is that species will track preferred climatic conditions through migration (climate tracking). In montane ecosystems, it is generally thought that species will move upslope to track preferred temperature regimes. This hypothesis makes two predictions: 1) individual species exhibit range shifts with concomitant climate preferences, and 2) ecological communities shift in favor of more warm-adapted and dry-adapted species, a process known as thermophilization and mesophilization respectively (). There is mixed support for upslope climate-tracking in montane ecosystems. While many species have migrated upslope in recent decades (), there is a considerable number who have not shifted their elevational distributions or who have migrated downslope. Three mechanisms are believed to lead to these idiosyncratic responses in montane ecosystems. First, dispersal limitation may limit the migration of species upslope, leading to elevational distributions that are discouple with preferred climate (). Second, species' ranges may be governed by climatic factors beyond temperature, like precipitation and water balance, that can facilitate downslope migration (). Third, changes in biotic interaction can facilitate downlope, upslope, or no change in species ranges. Idiosyncratic responses to recent environmental change has muddled a general theory of climate-tracking, and it remains unclear to what extant they scale up to directional changes in community-level outcomes. ().

Paragraph 3: Novel Solutions

-   Despite idiosyncratic range shifts, ecological communities can still display the signatures of climate change drives community composition at a site.

    -   Alternatively, if species composition is not governed by climate, or if the majority of species respond to different environmental or biotic factors, there might be no signature of climate change at the community-level.

-   However, there are three key limitations that have generally limited our understanding of how ecological range shifts scale up to community-level outcomes.

    -   First, most studies focus solely on climate warming.

    -   Second, Long-term assessments on of community changes are rare.

    -   Third, many studies focus on a single elevational transect.

\*Highlight a few reasons of why we would see variable effects.

Ecological communities can display the signatures of climate change despite idiosyncratic range shifts if overall effects of climate on the local community are strong. Alternatively, if the majority of species respond to different environmental and biotic factors, there might be no signature of climate change at the community-level. Three key limitations have generally limited our understand of how species' range shifts scale up to community-level outcomes. First, there is overemphasis on the role of temperature in driving species distributions, when other climatic factors may be important. Second, Long-term community assessments are rare. Lastly, the majority of research has focused on a single elevational transect, although species have been shown to respond differently throughout their range.

Paragraph 4: Study Questions/hypotheses

-   We address these limitations using a dataset, originally collected by Joseph Grinnell, that spans nearly \~100 years of contemporary climate change.

    -   Species have shown to have idiosyncratic responses across elevation and between regions.

-   We highlight how communities are responding to precipitation, as well as temperature.

-   The scale of our study spans three regions in montane California.

second sentence as topic sentence, first is a bit vague. can mirror paragraph 3 structure here e.g. could observe more variability in outcomes. Int this study we did 1) longterm 2) precipitatin 3) across regions. general readership mention mountains in a general way. highlight why these small mammal communities are a good case study 1) display idiosyncratic range shifts 2) lacking research 3) long-term. Mention Joseph Grinnell.

In this study, we used a nearly century-old dataset on the elevational distribution of small-mammals, originally collected by Joseph Grinnell and his students, to understand how idiosyncratic shifts in species ranges affect community-level outcomes of climate-tracking in montane California. We focus on two aspects of climate, temperature and precipitation, to understand how ecological communities have changed over the past one hundred years. We take into account that species respond to climate differently across their range by including three regions in our analysis. We test the prediction that small-mammal communities are comprised of more warm-adapted and dry-adapted species despite idiosyncratic elevational range shifts.

# Methods

Small-mammal communities used in this study were surveyed along elevational transects across three regions in montane California: near Lassen Volcanic National Park ("Northern"), Yosemite National Park ("Central"), and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks ("Southern"). Elevational extant decreases with latitude, while topographical complexity increases. Over the past xx-xx years, temperatures have risen on average xx in Northern sites, xx in Central sites, and xx in Southern sites. We observed changes in mean annual temperature (MAT) in central and southern sites to increase with elevation, inline with global patterns of elevation-dependent warming [citation, PRISM]. With the exception of low-elevation northern sites, most sites showed decreases in mean annual precipitation (MAP) between historical and contemporary surveys. MAP has decreased by xx in northern sites, xx in central sites, and xx in southern sites. [Forest ecology of the sites].

**Species climate preferences**

We estimated the temperature and precipitation preferences for each species using occurrence data downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (DOI: <https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.7x7sex>). Thermal and precipitation preferences for each species were estimated using the location of occurrence records from GBIF (downloaded on []; link to doi). We first filtered all occurrences to those recorded as "occurrence", or those representing collected specimens. All records without latitude and longitude were removed. To remove spurious records, we used species' range maps from the IUCN (DOI: <https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.7x7sex>; citation). All data more than three times the buffer (240km) were excluded. This step is conservative considering species' range maps are found to be accurate to around 80 km [citation]. If coordinate uncertainty was not reported, occurrences were discarded unless found within the IUCN rangemap. All occurrences with coordinate uncertainty greater than 1000m were excluded. Lastly, we excluded any occurrences with any remaining geospatial issues. Mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) from 1901 to 2021 were extracted for each occurrence using ClimateNA software (ClimateNA citation). The recorded temperature and precipitation for each occurrence was measured as the 31-year average (+-15 years) around the date of collection. Species' temperature and precipitation preferences were measured as the median temperature and precipitation of each species' records.

***Small Mammal Range Data***

Species' elevational range data for the 34 species in this study come from Rowe *et al.* 2015, and were generated as part of the Grinnell Resurvey Project (<https://mvz.berkeley.edu/Grinnell/index.html>) at UC Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (<https://mvz.berkeley.edu>). A prolific [note taker], Joseph Grinnell surveyed California's small mammal and bird diversity, including sites across three elevational transects in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. Small mammal diversity was recorded from 1911 to 1934, and include 34 sites from Lassen (northern) National Park in [the southern cascade range], 47 sites from Yosemite National Park (central), and 53 sites from Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (southern). These transects were surveyed again between 2003 and 2010, and include 38 sites in Lassen, 81 sites in Yosemite, and 47 sites in Sequoia and Kings Canyon. Rowe et al. 2015 estimated the elevational range shifts (herein range shifts) of 34 nonvolant small mammals across these three regions: Lassen, Yosemite National Park, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks. Sites span [] degrees of latitude and vary in their climate and [physiogomy], with temperatures increasing and precipitation decreasing towards the south (check this). Range shifts for 28 species not easily observable were estimated using an unpaired-site and single-season occupancy modelling framework (Mackenzie & Nichols 2004 check this, this is in older paper), that estimates the probability of detection and probability of occupancy for each species [at each site]. A species was considered absent at a site if the probability of false absence was less than 5% (pfa \< 0.05). See Rowe et al. 2015 [] for additional details on estimating species' range shifts.

Add year data.

***Community climate indices***

For each historical site, we created a species by site matrix for historical and modern eras. A species was deemed present if the site's elevation was included in the species' elevational range for each era respectively (see Rowe et al. for details on measure species' elevational ranges). We measured the historical and contemporary community temperature index (CTI) and community precipitation index (CPI) at each site as the median of species' thermal and precipitation preferences, respectively, for all species present. Thermophilization and mesophilization rates were calculated for each region separately by diving changes in the CTI/CPI by the number of years spanning historical and modern censuses.

**Statistical Analyses.**

Second, we created an 80 km buffer [sf package] around the species' IUCN range map []. Range maps were found accurate by 80km... [appropriate citation]. Records more than three times the buffer (240km) were excluded. For records where coordinate uncertainty was not available, we included only those within the IUCN range. We extracted annual climate data for the location of each records from 1901-200x using ClimateNA software [citation]. We measured the preferred temperature and preferred precipitation of each species as the mean of the these measurements 15 years before and 15 years after the occurrence was created (31 years total). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that considers when an occurrence was recorded when assigning annual climate values\...
