# Abstract

Climate change has widespread effects on the distribution, abundance, and behavior of species around the world, leading to the reshuffling of ecological communities. However, it remains unclear whether individual species' range shifts scale up to result in directional changes in the composition of entire communities. We measured community-wide climate indices of small-mammal communities in historical and modern eras across three regions in the Sierra Nevada of California (Lassen, Yosemite, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks) by capitalizing on a century-old data set originally collected by Joseph Grinnell and his students, and published range shifts. Across this time period, mean annual temperature in each region increased and total annual precipitation decreased. We tested whether small-mammal communities have shifted their composition in favor of species more hot- and dry-adapted, processes known as thermophilization and mesophilization respectively. We found positive thermophilization rates in all three regions and negative mesophilization rates in two of the three regions. Our results suggest that the net effects of climate change will be directional at the scale of the ecological community, despite variability in individual species responses to environmental change and the varied mechanisms that govern them.

# Introduction

Climate change has widespread effects on the distribution [@Chen2011], abundance [@Bowler2017], and behavior [@Loe2016] of species around the world, leading to the reshuffling of ecological communities [@Williams2007]. The effects of climate change are particularly pronounced in montane ecosystems where compressed environmental gradients lead to rapid turnover in biodiversity across elevation [@Sanders2012; @Graham2014]. Montane ecosystems comprise about 25% percent of terrestrial land area, yet harbor 87% of global terrestrial species richness [@Rahbek2019]. Given the disproportionate contribution of montane ecosystems to global biodiversity, understanding how they respond to climate change is imperative for safeguarding biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides [@Sundqvist2013; @Pecl2017; @Duque2021].

One prominent mechanism to explain biodiversity responses to climate change is that species will track their preferred climate conditions by migrating to new areas with suitable climates [@Colwell2008; @Pecl2017]. This climate-tracking hypothesis makes two predictions: 1) individual species exhibit range shifts concomitant with their climate preferences, and 2) ecological communities exhibit increases in the relative abundances, and changes in composition, in favor of the species best-adapted to novel climate conditions at a site. In montane ecosystems, it is generally thought that species will move upslope to track preferred temperature regimes [@Thuiller2007; @Feeley2012; @Lenoir2015]. However, there is mixed support for upslope climate-tracking in montane ecosystems. While many species have moved to higher elevation in recent decades [@Chen2011; @Mamantov2021], there is a considerable number who have not shifted their elevational distributions or who have migrated downslope [@Rubenstein2023].

Three mechanisms are believed to lead to these idiosyncratic range shifts in montane ecosystems. First, dispersal limitation may limit the upslope migration of species, leading to elevational distributions that are decoupled from preferred climate [@Wen2022]. Second, species' ranges may be governed by climatic factors beyond temperature, like precipitation and water balance, that can facilitate downslope migration [@Crimmins2011; @Tingley2009]. Elevational changes in biotic interaction can facilitate downslope, upslope, or no change in species ranges [@HilleRisLambers2013; @Alexander2015]. Given the variable responses of individual species to climate change, it remains unclear whether individual species' range shifts scale up to result in directional changes in the composition of entire communities.

Many communities are shifting in favor of more warm-adapted and dry-adapted species, a process known as thermophilization and mesophilization respectively [@Devictor2012; @Feeley2012; @Duque2015]. These studies seem to suggest that net directional changes in the composition of ecological communities are prevalent despite the high variability in species-level responses to recent climate change. Ecological communities can display the signatures of climate change despite idiosyncratic range shifts if overall effects of climate on the local community are strong [@Devictor2012; @Fadrique2018]. For example, while the climate-tracking hypothesis posits a key role of migration, it does not explicitly consider community-level responses that may result from selective effects of climate change on other demographic processes (growth, survival, or reproduction), phenotypic plasticity, or local adaptation of species within a local community. Alternatively, if the majority of species respond to different environmental and biotic factors, there might be no signature of climate change at the community-level.

Three key limitations have generally limited our understanding of how species' range shifts scale up to community-level outcomes. First, there is overemphasis on the role of temperature in driving species distributions, when other climatic factors such as precipitation may be important [@Tingley2009; @Ackerly2010]. Second, long-term community assessments are rare. The duration of most ecological research is around five years [@Estes2018], despite the importance of long-term studies in furthering theory and understanding biodiversity responses to global change [@Franklin1990; @Kuebbing2018]. Century-long studies are exceedingly uncommon, but offer some of the best evidence for climate change's impact on biodiversity [@Tingley2009; @Morueta-Holme2015]. Lastly, the majority of research has focused on single elevational transects, although species have been shown to respond differently throughout their range [@Tingley2012; @Rapacciuolo2014].

In a previous study, @Rowe2015 estimated the historical and contemporary elevational ranges for small mammals across montane California, USA, using species survey data from sites originally collected by Joseph Grinnell and his students in the early 1900s [@Grinnell1924; @Grinnell1930; @Sumner1953], and resurveys of the same sites from 2003 to 2011. They found no single species shifted their range in the same way across three different regions in three national parks (Lassen Volcanic, Yosemite, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon). We capitalize on this nearly century-old data set, to explicitly test whether the net effects of climate change on small mammal communities are directional in the face of high variability in individual species' range shifts. We incorporate two aspects of climate, temperature and precipitation, to understand how ecological communities have changed over the past one hundred years. Mean annual temperature has increased, and total annual precipitation has decreased, in all three regions between historical and contemporary surveys (Fig. 1). Specifically, we test the prediction that small mammal communities are comprised of more warm-adapted and dry-adapted species after a century of climate warming and

# Methods

We evaluated community-level responses of small-mammal communities using community-wide climate indices commonly used to study how ecological communities respond to climate change [@Devictor2012; @Feeley2013]. To generate these indices, we first used historical and modern species' elevational range data from three elevational transects to determine species composition at a site. We then averaged the preferred temperature and precipitation regimens of each species present at a site, estimated using the location of occurrence records, to calculate a community temperature index (CTI) and community precipitation index (CPI) for historical and modern eras.

***Small Mammal Range Data***

Species' elevational range data for the 34 nonvolant small-mammal species in this study, namely rodents and lagomorphs, come from @Moritz2008 and @Rowe2015 , and were generated as part of the Grinnell Resurvey Project (<https://mvz.berkeley.edu/Grinnell/index.html>) at the University of California's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (<https://mvz.berkeley.edu>). Joseph Grinnell and his students surveyed California's small mammal and bird diversity, including sites across three elevational transects the Sierra Nevada [@Grinnell1924; @Grinnell1930; @Sumner1953]. Small-mammal composition was recorded from 1911 to 1934, and include 34 sites from Lassen National Park in the southern Cascade range (northern region, 91-2487 m), 47 sites from Yosemite National Park (central region, 118-3419 m), and 53 sites from Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (southern region, 63-3292 m). @Moritz2008 and @Rowe2015 resurveyed these transects between 2003 and 2010, including 38 sites in Lassen, 81 sites in Yosemite, and 47 sites in Sequoia and Kings Canyon. Using these data, the elevational range shifts (herein range shifts) of nonvolant small mammals across these three regions were estimated using occupancy-detection modeling [@Moritz2008; @Rowe2015]. See @Moritz2008 and @Rowe2015 for additional details on estimating species' range shifts. The resulting data included the historical and modern elevational ranges of nonvolant mammals in northern, central, and southern regions.

***Species climate preferences***

We estimated the thermal and precipitation preferences for the 34 small-mammal species included using occurrence data downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (data DOI: <https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.7x7sex>). Thermal and precipitation preferences were estimated across the entire range of each species using climate data at the location of each occurrence record. Previous research using these methods typically use 30-year climate normals when assigning climate values to each record. We improve upon these methods by considering the exact year each record was collected, plus preceding years, which allows us to account for changes in climate at any given location. We first filtered all occurrences to those recorded as "occurrence", or those representing collected specimens. All records without latitude and longitude were removed. To remove spurious records, we used species' range maps from the IUCN [@IUCNshapefiles]. For a given species, specimens located outside a buffer of 240km around its range map were excluded. This allowed us to include specimen records just outside a species' range map, considering they are found to be accurate to around 80 km [@Hurlbert2007; @Seliger2021]. If coordinate uncertainty was not reported, occurrences were discarded unless found within the IUCN rangemap. All occurrences with coordinate uncertainty greater than 1000m were excluded. Lastly, we excluded any occurrences with any remaining geospatial issues. Mean annual temperature (MAT) and total annual precipitation (TAP) from 1901 to 2021 were extracted for each occurrence using ClimateNA software [@Wang2016]. The recorded temperature and precipitation for each occurrence was measured as the 31-year average (+-15 years) around the year of collection. We included additional years above or below the date of collection to ensure a span of 31 years for records without 15 years of available climate data before and after the date of collection. Species' thermal and precipitation preferences were measured as the median temperature and precipitation of the 31-year averages of each record (Fig. 2). The final data set used to measure species' thermal and precipitation preferences included 56041 occurrences, and these preferences varied considerably across species (Table S2).

***Community climate indices***

For each historical site originally surveyed by Grinnell, we created a species-by-site matrix using presence/absence data for historical and modern eras. A species was deemed present if the site's elevation overlapped with the species' elevational range for each respective era. We measured the historical and contemporary community temperature index (CTI) and community precipitation index (CPI) at each of these sites as the median of species' thermal and precipitation preferences, respectively, for all species present. Because our analysis utilized species presence-absence data [@Rowe2015], changes in the community climate indices at each site are the result of changes in species composition. Thermophilization and mesophilization rates were calculated for each region separately by dividing the net change in the CTI and CPI by the average number of years spanning historical and modern surveys (northern = 81 years, central = 84 years, southern = 96 years). We used Climate NA [@Wang2016] and the same time spans to calculate changes in MAT and TAP at each site (± 15-years from historical and modern censuses, northern = 1926-2007, central = 1916-2010, southern = 1913-2009). We included additional years above or below historical and modern censuses to ensure a span of 31 years for censuses without 15 years of available climate data before and after its date of occurrence.

**Statistical Analyses.**

All analyses were performed in R version 4.3.1 [@R]. Data tidying and formatting were performed using tidyverse packages [@tidyverse2019]. All spatial procedures used with occurrence data utilized functions from the sf package [@R-sf]. We used a one-tailed t-test to test whether communities in each region have positive thermophilization and negative mesophilization rates. To test for differences in thermophilization and mesophilization rates between regions, we used a one-way ANOVA. We evaluated whether small mammal communities were tracking climate by assessing whether small-mammal communities were

Over the past \~100 years mean annual temperatures have risen in all three regions (Fig. 1): Northern sites have risen 1.1°C on average, central sites have risen 1.4°C, and southern sites have risen 1.5°C. Temperatures rose more at higher elevations than lower elevations among central and southern sites (Fig. S1). Total annual precipitation has decreased 79 mm on average in northern sites from 1047 mm, 87 mm in central sites from 1044, and 120 mm in southern sites from 628 (Fig. 1). An important exception to these patterns are low-elevation northern sites that have higher precipitation in the modern era. All sites showed elevation-dependent drying, with higher elevations experiencing the largest decreases in precipitation (Fig. S1).

We observed positive and significant thermophilization rates across all three regions (one-sided t-test, Fig. 3). In the northern region, the mean thermophilization rate across sites was significantly different from zero (2.42 x 10^-3^ °C yr^−1^, t = 3.44, P \< 0.001) and positive in 80% of sites (Fig. 3,4). In the central region, the mean thermophilization rate was significantly different from zero (2.34 x 10^-3^ °C yr^-1^, t = 2.90, P \< 0.01) and positive in 51% of sites. In the southern region, the mean thermophilization rate was significantly different from zero (5.66 x 10^-3^ °C yr^-1^, t = 4.53, P \< 0.001) and positive in 63% of sites. We observed the greatest thermophilization rates at mid-elevations in southerns sites (Fig. 3). Thermophilization rates did not differ between sites (ANOVA, F~2,84~ = 1.92, P = 0.15).

We observed negative mesophilization rates (movement of communities toward species preferring drier conditions) across all three regions, but only northern and central regions were significant (one-sided t-test, Fig. 3). Among northern sites the mean mesophilization rate was significantly less than zero (-0.65 mm yr^-1^, t = -2.05, P \< 0.025) and we observed an equal proportion of sites had negative and positive mesophilization rates (Figs. 3,4). Among central sites, the mean mesophilization rate was significantly less than zero (-0.20 mm yr^-1^, t = -2.41, P \< 0.01) and 60% of sites showed evidence for negative mesophilization. Among southern sites, the mean mesophilization rate did not differ significantly from zero (-0.09 mm yr^-1^, t = -1.65, P = 0.052) and 44% of sites showed evidence for negative mesophilization. Mesophilization rates did not differ between sites (ANOVA, F~2,84~ = 1.31, P

# Discussion

Our analyses show that the composition of small-mammal communities across montane California are shifting in favor of more warm- and dry-adapted species. MAT increased at all sites in our study (Fig. 2). Except for the warmest low-elevation northern sites, TAP decreased (Fig. 2). In line with a recent analysis showing elevational-dependent warming is a common phenomenon worldwide, the magnitude of the increase in MAT in central and southern sites increased with elevation [Fig. S1, @Pepin2015]. Species range shifts in response to recent climate change has led to positive thermophilization rates across all three regions, and negative mesophilization rates in two of the three regions. While we acknowledge the difficulty for any one theory to predict the direction and magnitude of species' responses to climate change, we argue the net effects of climate change at the scale of biological communities will be directional and concomitant with ongoing changes in temperature and precipitation.

Our results provide strong evidence that small mammal communities across the Sierra Nevada are comprised of more warm-adapted species compared to the past. Thermophilization rates were positive across all three regions, and effect sizes were comparable to previous research using these methods on birds [@Devictor2012], butterflies [@Devictor2012], and plants [@DeFrenne2013; @Fadrique2018]. Two mechanisms can contribute to positive thermophilization rates among our sites: range expansions and range contractions. In recent years, high-elevation (cool-adapted) species including the alpine chipmunk (*Tamius alpinus*) and the Belding's ground squirrel (*Urocitellus beldingi*) have shown range contractions at the lower edge of their ranges, while low-elevation (warm-adapted) species like the pinyon mouse (*Peromyscus truei*) and the Californian pocket mouse (*Chaetodipus californicus*) show range expansions at their upper edges. Both of these mechanisms, the expansion of low-elevation species and the contraction of high elevation species, contribute simultaneously to the high thermophilization rates at mid-elevations in central and southern regions (Fig. 3).

The small mammal communities in our study also show evidence for mesophilization (Fig. 3). Mesophilization rates were negative among northern and central regions. Importantly, the majority of sites in central and and southern regions have negative mesophilization rates (Fig. 4). These results suggest decreases in precipitation across the Sierra Nevada have also contributed to directional shifts in community composition.

Although there are region-wide trends of thermophilization and mesophilization in this study, we note the variability in these rates across sites (Fig. 3). Biotic interactions, vegetation dynamics, and behavioral buffering, are two mechanisms that can introduce variation in thermophilization and mesophilization rates. For example, low- and mid-elevation species in Yosemite expanded their ranges by tracking suitable vegetation [@Santos2015]. Slow rates of thermophilization and mesophilization might be due to the inability for mammals to shift their ranges because of a lack of suitable vegetation. Furthermore, low rates of thermophilization and mesophilization might be due to the behavioral buffering capacity of mammal species at a site. Despite increases in temperature, small-mammal communities in California's Mojave desert were found to be largely stable over the past century (with only moderate turnover, \~2 species) because of low physiological exposure to climate change through burrowing [@Riddell2021]. If mammals across elevation are able to behaviorally thermoregulate through microhabitat selection, species may not shift their ranges and thermophilization and mesophilization rates will be low.

Alarmingly, thermophilization and negative mesophilization rates lag behind temperature and precipitation change in each region (Fig. 5). Compositional change in small mammal communities in the Sierra Nevada are decoupled from regional warming and drying. While differences between thermophilization and mesophilization rates and compositional change can be explained through microhabitat selection, they can also occur from the inability for species to respond to climate change fast enough. If small mammal communities across the Sierra Nevada cannot keep pace with climate change, they are at risk of population collapse. Previous studies of species-level responses to climate change in the Sierra Nevada suggest no universal explanation for species' range shifts [add citations]. Our analyses highlight the importance of biological scale in studying the effects of climate change on biodiversity. We show that despite heterogeneous range shifts in small-mammals across montane California, communities are displaying the signatures of climate warming and drying. Therefor, we argue that the net effects of climate change will be directional at the scale of the ecological community, despite variability in individual species responses to environmental change and the varied mechanisms that govern them.
