# Introduction

Climate change has widespread effects on the distribution [@Chen2011], abundance [@Bowler2017], and behavior [@Loe2016] of species around the world, leading to the reshuffling of ecological communities [@Williams2007]. The effects of climate change are particularly pronounced in montane ecosystems where compressed environmental gradients lead to rapid turnover in biodiversity across elevation [@Sanders2012; @Graham2014]. Montane ecosystems comprise % percent of terrestrial land area, yet harbor 87% of global terrestrial species richness [@Rahbek2019]. Given the disproportionate contribution of montane ecosystems to global biodiversity, understanding how they respond to climate change is imperative for safeguarding biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides [@Sundqvist2013; @Pecl2017; @Duque2021].

One prominent mechanism to explain biodiversity responses to climate change is that species will track their preferred climate conditions by migrating to new areas with suitable climates []. This climate-tracking hypothesis makes two predictions: 1) individual species exhibit range shifts concomitant with their climate preferences, and 2) ecological communities exhibit increases in the relative abundances, and changes in composition, in favor of the species best-adapted to novel climate conditions at a site []. Many communities are shifting in favor of more warm-adapted and dry-adapted species, a process known as thermophilization and mesophilization respectively [@Devictor2012; @Duque2015]. In montane ecosystems, it is generally thought that species will move upslope to track preferred temperature regimes [@Thuiller2007; @Feeley2012; @Lenoir2015]. However, there is mixed support for upslope climate-tracking in montane ecosystems. While many species have moved to higher elevation in recent decades [@Chen2011; @Mamantov2021], there is a considerable number who have not shifted their elevational distributions or who have migrated downslope [@Rubenstein2023]. Three mechanisms are believed to lead to these idiosyncratic range shifts in montane ecosystems. First, dispersal limitation may limit the migration of species upslope, leading to elevational distributions that are decoupled from preferred climate [@Wen2022]. Second, species' ranges may be governed by climatic factors beyond temperature, like precipitation and water balance, that can facilitate downslope migration [@Crimmins2011; @Tingley2009]. Third, elevational changes in biotic interaction can facilitate downlope, upslope, or no change in species ranges [@HilleRisLambers2013; @Alexander2015]. Given the variable responses of individual species to climate change, it remains unclear whether range shifts scale up to result in directional changes in community-level outcomes [].

Ecological communities can display the signatures of climate change despite idiosyncratic range shifts if overall effects of climate on the local community are strong [@Devictor2012; @Fadrique2018]. Alternatively, if the majority of species respond to different environmental and biotic factors, there might be no signature of climate change at the community-level. Three key limitations have generally limited our understand of how species' range shifts scale up to community-level outcomes. First, there is overemphasis on the role of temperature in driving species distributions, when other climatic factors may be important [@Tingley2009]. Second, Long-term community assessments are rare. Lastly, the majority of research has focused on a single elevational transect, although species have been shown to respond differently throughout their range.

In this study, we address these limitations by using a data set on the elevational distribution of small-mammals spanning nearly a century [@Rowe2015], originally collected by Joseph Grinnell and his students, to understand how shifts in species ranges affect community-level outcomes of climate-tracking in montane California. We focus on two aspects of climate, temperature and precipitation, to understand how ecological communities have changed over the past one hundred years. We take into account that species respond to climate differently across their range by including three National Parks in our analysis: Lassen Volcanic, Yosemite, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon. We test the prediction that small-mammal communities are comprised of more warm-adapted and dry-adapted species after a century of climate warming and drying.

# Methods

Small-mammal communities used in this study were surveyed along elevational transects across three regions in montane California: near Lassen Volcanic National Park ("Northern"), Yosemite National Park ("Central"), and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks ("Southern"). Elevational extant decreases with latitude, while topographical complexity increases.

We estimated the thermal and precipitation preferences for each of the 34 species included in our analysis using occurrence data downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (DOI: <https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.7x7sex>). Thermal and precipitation preferences were estimated from climate data at the location of each occurrence record. We first filtered all occurrences to those recorded as "occurrence", or those representing collected specimens. All records without latitude and longitude were removed. To remove spurious records, we used species' range maps from the IUCN [IUCN citation]. All data more than three times a buffer of 80 km (240km) were excluded. This step is conservative considering species' range maps are found to be accurate to around 80 km [@Hurlbert2007; @Seliger2021]. If coordinate uncertainty was not reported, occurrences were discarded unless found within the IUCN rangemap. All occurrences with coordinate uncertainty greater than 1000m were excluded. Lastly, we excluded any occurrences with any remaining geospatial issues. Mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) from 1901 to 2021 were extracted for each occurrence using ClimateNA software (ClimateNA citation). The recorded temperature and precipitation for each occurrence was measured as the 31-year average (+-15 years) around the date of collection. For records without 15 years of available climate data before and after the data of collection, we included additional years above or below the date of collection to ensure a span of 31 years. Species' thermal and precipitation preferences were measured as the median temperature and precipitation of each species' records. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to consider the year of collection when calculating community-wide indices.

***Small Mammal Range Data***

Species' elevational range data for the 34 species in this study come from @Rowe2015, and were generated as part of the Grinnell Resurvey Project (<https://mvz.berkeley.edu/Grinnell/index.html>) at UC Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (<https://mvz.berkeley.edu>). A prolific [note taker], Joseph Grinnell surveyed California's small mammal and bird diversity, including sites across three elevational transects in California's mountains. Small mammal diversity was recorded from 1911 to 1934, and include 34 sites from Lassen National Park in the southern cascade range (northern), 47 sites from Yosemite National Park (central), and 53 sites from Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (southern). These transects were surveyed again between 2003 and 2010, and include 38 sites in Lassen, 81 sites in Yosemite, and 47 sites in Sequoia and Kings Canyon. Sites span [] degrees of latitude and vary in their climate and [physiogomy], with temperatures increasing and precipitation decreasing towards the south (check this). @Rowe2015 estimated the elevational range shifts (herein range shifts) of nonvolant small mammals across these three regions. Range shifts for 28 species not easily observable were estimated using an unpaired-site and single-season occupancy modelling framework (Mackenzie & Nichols 2004 check this, this is in older paper), that estimates the probability of detection and probability of occupancy for each species [at each site]. A species was considered absent at a site if the probability of false absence was less than 5% (pfa \< 0.05). The resulting data included the historical and modern altitudinal ranges of nonvolant mammals in northern, central, and southern regions. See @Rowe2015 for additional details on estimating species' range shifts.

***Community climate indices***

For each historical site, we created a species by site matrix for historical and modern eras. A species was deemed present if the site's elevation was included in the species' elevational range for each respective era. We measured the historical and contemporary community temperature index (CTI) and community precipitation index (CPI) at each site as the median of species' thermal and precipitation preferences, respectively, for all species present. Thermophilization and mesophilization rates were calculated for each region separately by diving changes in the CTI/CPI by the number of years spanning historical and modern censuses.

**Statistical Analyses.**

All analyses were performed in R []. We used Tidyverse packages for all data tidying and figures []. All spatial procedures on occurrence data used functions from the sf package [].

Over the past \~100 years temperatures have risen in all three regions (Fig. 1): Northern sites have risen 1.1°C, central sites have risen 1.4°C, and southern sites have risen 1.5°C. We observed a positive effect of elevation on site warming in central and southern regions, in line with a recent analysis showing elevational-dependent warming is a common phenomenon worldwide [@Pepin2015].

Mean annual precipitation has decreased 126 mm in northern sites, 87 mm in central sites, and 120 mm in southern sites (Fig. 1). An important exception to these patterns are low-elevation northern sites that have higher precipitation regimens in the modern era. All sites showed elevation-dependent drying, with higher elevations experiencing the largest decreases in precipitation (Fig. S1).

The final data set used to measure species' thermal and precipitation preferences included 56041 occurrences, and these preferences varied considerably across species (Table S2). There is considerable variation in the extant to which small-mammal communities have changed since original surveys, but community richness shows an overall decline (Fig S2). We observed positive and significant region-wide thermophilization rates across all three regions (one-sided t-test, Fig. 2). Thermophilization rates decreased with latitude, with the fastest rates occurring in southern sites (Fig. S3). In the northern region, 80% of all sites showed evidence for thermophilization, while only 16% showed a decrease in the CTI (Fig. 2). In the central region, 51% of sites showed evidence for thermophilization, 23% had no change, and 26% sites showed a decrease in the CTI. In the southern region, 63% of all sites showed evidence for thermophilization, only 4% of sites had no change, and 33% sites showed a decrease in the CTI. We observed the greatest thermophilization rates at mid-elevations in southerns sites (Fig. 2).

We also observed evidence for mesophilization in all three regions, but only northern and central regions were had mesophilization rates significantly less than zero (Fig. 2). Despite region-wide mesophilization rate in the northern region to be less than zero in northern sites, we observed an equal proportion of sites showed decreases and increases in the CPI. In the central region, 60% of sites showed evidence for mesophilization, 9% sites exhibited no change in the CPI, and 31% of sites had positive mesophilization rates. In the southern region, 44% of sites showed evidence for mesophilization, 26% of sites had no change in the CPI, and 30% of sites had positive mesophilization rates.
